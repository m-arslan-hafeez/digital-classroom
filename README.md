The user has to Login as Student, then from the Lecture Center, he/she can set Multiple Questions with Multiple Choice Answers. All the questions set from the lecturer center are displayed to the students and the student has to Enter answers in a square textBox. After completing it, the system automatically generates studentâ€™s report. The lecture can view class test reports and past test reports and all the results are stored in Database too. This project is designed pretty simple as it is easy to operate and understood by the users.
